I am the AI/Robotics Software Engineer at the [A³ by Airbus](https://www.airbus-sv.com/). I work on the various autonomy tasks in the [Wayfinder](https://www.airbus-sv.com/projects/10) project.

Previously, I was the Autopilot Software Engineer of Autopilot Department at [Tesla Inc](https://www.tesla.com/). In this role, I contributed to the development of vehicle intelligence software, namely behavior planning, path planning and controls, for Tesla’s Model S, E, X cars. Prior to my role at Tesla Inc, I was the Robotics Research Engineer at [Voyage Auto, Inc](https://voyage.auto/). I was responsible for the development of fast, reliable motion planning and controls software for self-driving taxis.

My academic research interests include motion planning, machine learning, computer vision, control of multi-agent systems, dynamic modeling, guidance, navigation, and control for robotic systems and autonomous vehicles. Before joining Tesla and Voyage, I worked as the Robotics Technologist at [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov)/[Caltech](https://www.caltech.edu) [Jet Propulsion Laboratory](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov) where I contributed to several projects and led the development of decision making and planning software for various robotic platforms. 

During my doctoral studies, I had the opportunity to work as the research intern at [Mitsubishi Electric Research Labs](https://www.merl.com/) and did Co-op as the Guidance, Navigation, and Controls Engineer at [Aurora Flight Sciences](https://www.aurora.aero/) where I developed the high-level route planner for full-scale autonomous Boeing helicopter during Autonomous Aerial Cargo Utility System (AACUS). 

I obtained a Ph.D. degree in Robotics, dual M.S. degrees in Computer Science and Aerospace Engineering all from the [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/). I also earned a M.S. degree in Defense Technologies and dual B.Sc. degrees in Computer Engineering and Electrical Engineering all from the [Istanbul Technical University](http://www.itu.edu.tr/).
